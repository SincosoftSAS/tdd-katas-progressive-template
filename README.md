## 💻 Working on This Kata



### TDD Workflow (Red → Green → Refactor)### Setup# Read instructions



1. **Read the requirements** in `.github/kata-definitions/kata-01-fizzbuzz.md`cat katas/01-fizzbuzz/README.md

2. **Run tests**: `dotnet test` (they should fail - Red ❌)

3. **Write minimal code** in `FizzBuzz/FizzBuzz.cs` to make tests pass```bash```

4. **Run tests again**: `dotnet test` (they should pass - Green ✅)

5. **Refactor** your code to improve it# Restore dependencies

6. **Repeat** until all requirements are met

### Files to Edit



- `FizzBuzz/FizzBuzz.cs` - Your implementation goes here

- `FizzBuzz.Tests/FizzBuzzTests.cs` - You can add more tests as you progress# Build the project1. Switch to kata branch



### When You're Donedotnet build2. Read README.md



```bash3. Follow TDD (Red → Green → Refactor)

# Commit your work

git add .# Run tests (they should fail initially - that's expected!)4. Run tests locally

git commit -m "Implement FizzBuzz kata"

dotnet test5. Push for evaluation

# Push to trigger evaluation

git push origin main```6. Next kata unlocks automatically!

```



**GitHub Actions** will:

- ✅ Run your tests (4 visible tests)---Happy coding! �����

- ✅ Run additional hidden tests (7 more tests)

- ✅ Update your [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) automatically

- ✅ If all pass: Unlock Kata 02 automatically! 🎉## 📖 Kata Instructions
